# Notes on David Woods's Resilience Engineering short course

These are my personal, unofficial notes on [David
Woods's](https://complexity.osu.edu/people/woods.2) Resilience Engineering
short couse.

Official page: <http://csel.org.ohio-state.edu/ResilienceEngineering.html>

The lectures are available for free online at the link above.

## Lectures

The videos on the official page are in iframes, which prevented me from viewing
them in full screen mode. Here are direct links to the videos, which allows you to view them full screen.

## Readings

Woods mentions several readings in his lectures, but as of this writing there
isn't a publicly available list of them. I've tried to guess based on context.

## Researchers referenced multiple times in lectures

Roughly by order of how often they were referenced

* [John C. Doyle](http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~doyle/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) - robust-yet-fragile, control systems, biological applications
* [Elinor Ostrom](http://elinorostrom.com/) - tragedy of the commons & polycentric governance
* [Paul Feltovitch](https://www.ihmc.us/groups/pfeltovich/) - oversimplifications



## My notes by lecture

These are my personal notes I took. I took a combination of handwritten notes (using my [reMarkable](https://remarkable.com/) tablet) and typed notes:

* [Handwritten notes - all lectures](handwritten-notes)

### Typed notes

* [Lecture 2](lecture-2.md)
* [Lecture 3](lecture-3.md)
* [Lecture 4](lecture-4.md)
