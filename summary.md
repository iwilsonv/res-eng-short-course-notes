# The adaptive universe
- Finite resources
- Surprise is fundamental
- Change never stops

# Systems perspective

1. the behavior of a system is function of *interactions* of parts/components that make up the system.
2. Interactions happen across *multiple scales*. 
3. What is a system is a matter of *perspective* of the analyst who chooses the boundary

# Trade-offs

* Goals: acute vs chronic
* Plans: efficiency vs thoroughness
* Complex systems: optimality vs resilience

# Big picture

1. Adaptive histories
2. Precarious present
3. Resilient future

## Adaptive histories: empirical

What happens in adaptive cycles? (see below)

## Precarious present: assess where things stand

Systems are more precarious than we think
- different units in our tangled, layered network have models
- those models can be wrong

## Resilient future: action agenda

???


# Expertise

Ability to anticipate bottlenecks ahead & take actions to prepare.

- anticipate how we might get crunched/squeezed
- generate readiness to respond

# Within the competence envelope

Work to rule/role

It is necessary/good to pursue optimality.

# In the borderlands

Handling surprises regularly


# Fluency law

Well-adapted activity occurs with a facility that belies the difficulty of the
demands resolved and the dillemas balanced.

Adaptations hide what was adapted.

Competence envelope continually expands

Model surprise is always possible.

Optimizing within the competence envelope always makes you more brittle in the
borderlands.

# Net adaptive value

Joint function of:
- graceful extensibility
- optimality

# Adaptive cycles
- Studies of resilience in action
- regularities
- patterns
- descriptive
- explanation
- charting how changes reverberate through multi-role, multi-eschelon networks
- each response to change by some unit triggers adaptive responses across other
  units

 stalls <---reverb---> florescence


# Florescence
- change in one unit opens up new possibilities in other units
- the degree that changes in one area tend to recruit or open up beneficial
  changes in many other apsects of the network, which opens up new
  opportunities across the network
