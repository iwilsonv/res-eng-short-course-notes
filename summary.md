# The adaptive universe
- Finite resources
- Surprise is fundamental
- Change never stops

# Systems perspective

1. the behavior of a system is function of *interactions* of parts/components that make up the system.
2. Interactions happen across *multiple scales*. 
3. What is a system is a matter of *perspective* of the analyst who chooses the boundary

# Trade-offs

* Goals: acute vs chronic
* Plans: efficiency vs thoroughness
* Complex systems: optimality vs resilience

# Big picture

1. Adaptive histories
2. Precarious present
3. Resilient future

## Adaptive histories: empirical

What happens in adaptive cycles?
- regularities
- patterns
- descriptive
- explanation

## Precarious present: assess where things stand

Systems are more precarious than we think
- different units in our tangled, layered network have models
- those models can be wrong

## Resilient future: action agenda
