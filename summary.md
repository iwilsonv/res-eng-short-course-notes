# The adaptive universe
- Finite resources
- Surprise is fundamental
- Change never stops

# Systems perspective

1. the behavior of a system is function of *interactions* of parts/components that make up the system.
2. Interactions happen across *multiple scales*. 
3. What is a system is a matter of *perspective* of the analyst who chooses the boundary

# Trade-offs

* Goals: acute vs chronic
* Plans: efficiency vs thoroughness
* Complex systems: optimality vs resilience

# Big picture

1. Adaptive histories
2. Precarious present
3. Resilient future

## Adaptive histories: empirical

What happens in adaptive cycles? (see below)

## Precarious present: assess where things stand

Systems are more precarious than we think
- different units in our tangled, layered network have models
- those models can be wrong

## Resilient future: action agenda

???


# Expertise

Ability to anticipate bottlenecks ahead & take actions to prepare.

- anticipate how we might get crunched/squeezed
- generate readiness to respond

# Within the competence envelope

Work to rule/role

It is necessary/good to pursue optimality.

# In the borderlands

Handling surprises regularly


# Fluency law

Well-adapted activity occurs with a facility that belies the difficulty of the
demands resolved and the dillemas balanced.

Adaptations hide what was adapted.

Competence envelope continually expands

Model surprise is always possible.

Optimizing within the competence envelope always makes you more brittle in the
borderlands.

# Net adaptive value

Joint function of:
- graceful extensibility
- optimality

# Adaptive cycles

- Studies of resilience in action
- regularities
- patterns
- descriptive
- explanation
- charting how changes reverberate through multi-role, multi-eschelon networks
- each response to change by some unit triggers adaptive responses across other
  units
- pressing need intersects with apparently powerful capaability
- point of change revbereates through the network
- experience of adaptive shortfall (brittleness)
- responsible people act as generic adaptive and learning stop-gap to fill
  shortfall
- resulting in kludges (workarounds)
- new opportunities for innovation
- adaptive florescence

 stalls <---reverb---> florescence


# Adaptive florescence
- change in one unit opens up new possibilities in other units
- the degree that changes in one area tend to recruit or open up beneficial
  changes in many other apsects of the network, which opens up new
  opportunities across the network

# 3 breakdowns

1. Decompensation (complexities in time)
2. Desynchronization: Working at cross-purposes (complexities over scales)
3. Getting stuck in outdated behaviors (complexities in learning)


# Decompensation
- exhaust capacity to adapt
- "going solid"
- breakdown occurs when challenges grow and cascade faster than responses can
  be decided on and deployed to effect

# Desynchronization
- Teams are no longer coordinated
- fragmentation (silos)

# Complexities in learning
- every good controller is a model of system being controlled
- pursuing tragets in face of variation
- model surprise
- learning loops
- world changes, but system stuck in what were previously adaptive strategies
- proactive learnings vs. gettick stuck
- oversimplification
- fixation

# Capacity for maneuver (CfM)
- cushion of potential actions & additional resources that allow system to
  continue functinoning despite unexpected deamnds
- controlling risk of saturation
- critical parameter for controla nticipation
- there are regularities of what happens at borderlands
- can be measured

# Sustained adaptability
- anticipate vs decompensate
- synchronize across units vs work at cross purposes
- roles, levels, practive learning before failures vs. stuck in stale behaviors

# 10 theorems of adaptive universe

From [The theory of graceful extensibility: basic rules that govern adaptive systems]

1. Boundaries are universal
2. Surprise occurs, continuously
3. Risk of saturation is monitored and regulated
4. Synchronization across multiple units of adaptive behavior in a network is necessary
5. Risk of saturation can be shared
6. Pressure changes what is sacrificed when
7. Pressure for optimality undermines graceful extensibility
8. All adaptive units are local
9. Perspective contrast overcomes bounds
10. Reflective systems continually risk mis-calibration
